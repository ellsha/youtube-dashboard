## Areas for Improvement

#1 **Video Routing**:
Adding unique URLs for each video (`/videos/{id}`) so users can refresh the page without losing their place, share
videos, and bookmark them.

#2 **Dynamic Video Resizing**:
Making the video player adjust to 100% of the width or height (depending on screen size) while keeping 16:9 aspect
ratio.
